# Sign Language Detector for Video Conferencing

This project contains the demo application formulated in [Real-Time Sign Language Detection using Human Pose Estimation](https://research.google/pubs/pub49425/) published in [SLRTP 2020](https://slrtp.com/) and presented in the [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/) demo track.

We use the [tf.js models](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/sign_language_detection) open-sourced by Google research.

This demo app is available to try at [sign-language-detector.web.app](https://sign-language-detector.web.app/)
